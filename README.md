Formproject is about publishing translations for german official forms. They
are supposed to help refugees and migrants to cope with the german
administrative chaos.

The translations this is based on are published by [KuB
Berlin](//www.kub-berlin.org/formularprojekt/). They are created by volunteers
and are not official.

This repository contains

-   translations in JSON format (`data/`)
-   a python tool to create a website from those translations. (If you have
    virtualenv and lessc install, you can simply run `make`.)
